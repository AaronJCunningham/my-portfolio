      <p>
        As a frontend developer, my expertise lies in the development of web3
        and metaverse applications. With a unique blend of artistic and
        technical skills, I excel at crafting highly engaging online
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have worked for several prominent blockchain
        companies, including Coinsquare, Canada&apos;s largest cryptocurrency
        exchange, and IOST, a proof-of-stake blockchain platform based in Asia.

      <p>
        Currently, my focus is on web3 and metaverse development. In 2022 I
        helped RaveSpace, one of the world&apos;s leading metaverse development
        studios, launch their Musee Dezentral project, a museum dedicated to
        NFTS.
