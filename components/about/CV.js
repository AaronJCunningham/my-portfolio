      <p>
        As a frontend developer, my expertise lies in the development of web3
        and metaverse applications. With a unique blend of artistic and
        technical skills, I excel at crafting highly engaging online
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love building immersive web apps with Three.js and @react-three/fiber
        inside Next.js and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have worked for several prominent blockchain
        companies, including Coinsquare, Canada&apos;s largest cryptocurrency
        exchange, and IOST, a proof-of-stake blockchain platform based in Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, my focus is on web3 and browser-based metaverse development.
        In 2022 I helped RaveSpace, one of the world&apos;s leading metaverse
        development studios, launch their Musee Dezentral project, a museum
        dedicated to NFTs.
