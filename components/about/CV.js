      <p>
        As a frontend developer, my expertise lies in the development of
        blockchain, Web 3.0, and metaverse applications. With a unique blend of
        artistic and technical skills, I excel at crafting highly engaging
        online experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have worked for several prominent blockchain
        companies, including Coinsquare, Canada&apos;s largest cryptocurrency
        exchange, and IOST, a proof-of-stake blockchain platform based in Asia.

        Currently, my focus is on Web 3.0 and metaverse development. In 2022 I
        helped RaveSpace, one of the world&apos;s leading metaverse development
        studios, launch their Musee Dezentral project, a museum dedicated to
        NFTS.
